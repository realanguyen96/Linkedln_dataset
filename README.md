## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Our project focuses on analyzing job postings on LinkedIn in the USA last year, using a combination of datasets to ensure we cover all the necessary information. We prioritize data acquisition, preparation, cleaning, and aggregation to create a top-notch dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Through EDA, we aim to discover important insights into the job market, like popular skills, common job titles, where opportunities are located, and trends in different industries. By providing clear insights, our project aims to help decision-making and improve the job market.
